The vaginal suppository is inserted into the vagina similarly to a tampon. Once introduced, it dissolves within
10-15
minutes and achieves its soothing effect entirely unnoticed. Before it dissolves, you should remain laying down
to
prevent the suppository from dropping out. It works best in 2nd and 3rd days. Once dissolved, it will remain in
the
vagina without seepage and will last for 4-8 days depending on the product used. Unlike a tampon, you will not
need to
withdraw the suppository once inserted. It will disappear with time, similar to the disappearance of applied
body
lotion.
