Some women may have suffered dryness for a long time, so that they do not have enough secretion to dissolve the
water-soluble portion of the NeuEve suppository. The suppository includes both oil-soluble and water-soluble
materials
like a multi-vitamin pill (e.g., vitamin E is oil soluble while vitamin C is water soluble). As a result, a
portion of
the water-soluble materials may leak out. You should not be worried about this. Each time when you use a NeuEve
suppository, a small portion of the water-soluble material will be dissolved. Gradually, the glands will become
revived and more and more water-soluble materials will be dissolved and play a role in the maintenance of
feminine
wellness.
