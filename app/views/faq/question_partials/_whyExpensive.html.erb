NeuEve is a natural product that does not have any hormones. It works by providing needed nutrients to the atrophied
mucosal tissue, like calcium and vitamin D for osteoporotic bones. It carries a high value because the technology
took many years of research to develop. This is why it costs a little more than some low-value products that do not
work well.

For example, many years ago people took calcium pill for managing osteoporosis, but it did not work well. Later,
scientists found out that vitamin D helps calcium absorption and they incorporated it into calcium pills, making the
pills more effective. The new pills cost a little more than regular calcium pills because vitamin D adds value to
it.

Likewise, NeuEve works better in relieving vaginal dryness and atrophy than some low-value products because the
newly developed non-hormonal nutritional supplement technology adds value to it.
