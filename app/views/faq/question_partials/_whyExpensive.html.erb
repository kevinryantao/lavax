The NeuEve products are made with all natural ingredients and are all handmade. This is different from low priced
lubes that are machine-made with chemicals like glycerin or PEG found in the automobile antifreeze. Frequent use of
chemical lubes may cause dehydration of tissue, accelerating aging and resulting in premature atrophy. Let us use
automobile maintenance as an example. The cheap lube gels are like Jiffy-lube for cars. When the carâ€™s engine is
broken, you will need to rebuild or replace the engine, which may cost thousands. Jiffy-lube is cheap but would
still be a waste of money because it is useless for a broken engine.

At beginning of menopause, a lube gel may work by providing temporary lubrication. However, after a while vaginal
atrophy (shrinking) begins, a cheap lube gel would become a waste of money because it cannot reverse atrophy and is
useless.

NeuEve works differently. It provides nourishment to the tissue and can allow the atrophic tissue to grow back and
help women to regain self-lubrication. Therefore, it is not appropriate to compare NeuEve with the low priced lube
gels. You should compare it with the price of a service or product that can relieve vaginal atrophy. For your
information, these are their prices:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Vaginal reconstruction surgery : $12,000/surgery</li>
    <li> Mona Lisa Touch Laser : $1,600/3 months.</li>
    <li> Estrace Vaginal Cream : $210/month</li>
    <li> Osphena : $189/month</li>
</ul>
<br>
The surgery and hormonal drugs work quickly but have potential health risks such as cancer. NeuEve works slowly.
Some women see results right way, but others may take months to observe significant recovery. You should be patient
to allow NeuEve to work for you. The best feature of NeuEve is that it is natural, green, organic and hormone free.
It does not have any side effects like chemical lubes or hormonal drugs. Many women previously on Osphena and/or
Estrace have switched to NeuEve and are very satisfied with the result. They said that the price of NeuEve is
reasonable and worth every penny.
