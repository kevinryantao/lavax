Antibiotics are good at eliminating true bacterial infections, but BV is not a true

infection but a disturbance of vaginal ecology. It is the reduction in the number of good

bacteria, lactobacilli, and increase in the bad bacteria, anaerobes. Let us use lawn care as

an example. The good lactobacilli are like lawn grass, while the bad anaerobes are like

weeds. When your lawn is nice and green without weeds, it is healthy. When weeds

overgrow to outnumber lawn grass, you have BV. Antibiotics are like Roundup that kills

all vegetation including weeds and lawn grasses. After the Roundup treatment, your lawn

may be again filled with weeds as the good grasses are also gone. But the probiotic

lactobacilli are like lawn grass seeds. If you put lawn grass seeds directly onto weeds,

they cannot eliminate weeds to establish growth.

NeuEve is like weed-n-feed for lawn care. It can clear BV naturally without using

Roundup. It suppresses weeds and feeds your lawn to build up a healthy turf. But if you

use the antibiotic cream first to roundup your lawn and weeds, and the weed-n-feed

(NeuEve) will not work as you will have nothing left to feed. Therefore, for BV

management is not recommended to use douche, antibiotics or antiseptics (such as boric

acid) before using NeuEve.
