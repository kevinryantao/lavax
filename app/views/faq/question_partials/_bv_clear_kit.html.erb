BV is not a true infection but an upset of vaginal ecology, namely a reduction

of friendly Lactobacillus bacteria and overgrowth of bad bacteria, which can be any

species. Let us use lawn care as an example. When you have a green turf and weeds are

under control, you are healthy, but if weeds outgrow lawn grass, you have BV. The

problem is that weeds can be any species. If they are common species like dandelions,

you can easily eliminate them with the regular weed-n-feed. However, if the weeds are

tenacious like crabgrass, the regular weed-n-feed may not work. You may need

something more potent. Since weed-n-feed is the cheapest product, people often try that

first to see if it works. Likewise, BV has many different types. Some have no symptoms,

while others have fishy odor, discharge, burning and/or itching depending on what

bacterial species overgrowing. Still, some other vaginal infections, such as yeast and

trich, may show BV-like symptoms and be misdiagnosed as BV. NeuEve as a “weed-n-

feed” like home remedy has worked for about 50% of women with BV. This is not a bad

rate of success because nearly all these women have tried nearly all other BV care

products under the sun before trying NeuEve. Making a product for BV relief is like

making dress for ladies. One-size cannot fit all. The fact that NeuEve works for some

women but not for others is normal. If you find NeuEve works for you, you have found

the "dress" of your "size" and can buy it for future use. The type of BV with typical fishy

odor often responds well. If your BV does not have a fishy odor, NeuEve may still work

but the likelihood of success may be lower. If you have tried NeuEve but your symptoms

persist, you may have a condition other than BV. Please visit your gyn to have a checkup.
