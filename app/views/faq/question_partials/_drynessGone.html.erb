Vaginal dryness is not a disease that can be cured. It is an aging outcome, like wrinkles. Wrinkles show up when
people reach mid-age, say in the 40s, but women often start using cream at a much younger age. The reason is
that an
early and regular use of cream can result in a later onset of wrinkles. If a woman stops using the anti-aging
cream
before mid-age, wrinkles may show up sooner. Wrinkles can be removed by botox, but it is costly and not without
risk.
Therefore using cream to manage wrinkles early is a better investment than having a botox later. Likewise, early
and
regular use of NeuEve can help women delay the onset of vaginal atrophy. It allows women to enjoy many more
years of
romantic intimacy and a healthful lifestyle.
