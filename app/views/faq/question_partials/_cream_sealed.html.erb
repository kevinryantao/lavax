If you were purchasing a loaf of bread on the shelf in a supermarket, it must be sealed inside a plastic bag because
other customers may open it. However, if you purchase a loaf of fresh bread in a restaurant as a part of your meal,
it is not sealed in any bag. It would be brought to you openly on a plate. It is safe because other customers will
not touch it except you. Of course, you can ask the restaurant to seal it for you, but this would add unnecessary
cost.

Likewise, our products are sealed only if they are sold in stores. From Amazon or from our own website, we do not
seal them. They are sent to you directly from the warehouse and no one else can open it except you. It is safe.
