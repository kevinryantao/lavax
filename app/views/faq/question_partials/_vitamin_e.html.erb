Vaginal atrophy or dryness is a dysfunction associated with aging, like osteoporosis. Let us use osteoporosis as an
example. To find relief for osteoporosis, you need to provide the right nutritional supplements, namely calcium and
vitamin D. Eating chocolate may give you comfort, but it does not improve the osteoporotic bone. Continue eating
chocolate for relieving osteoporosis will soon facing bone fractures.

Can vitamin E reverse vaginal atrophy? The answer is "No." The cause of vaginal atrophy is complex, but it is not
associated with vitamin E deficiency. Therefore, supplementing vitamin E for vaginal atrophy would be the same as
eating chocolate for osteoporosis. The reason that you felt comforting is due to the oil that dissolves the
fat-soluble vitamin E functioning as a lubricant. You can get the same lubrication effect just by using coconut oil.
However, they have no effect on stopping, delaying or reversing vaginal atrophy.

So far, more than 30,000 women have been using NeuEve for vaginal atrophy. Nearly all of them are previous users of
vitamin E suppository. After they have used vitamin E suppositories and still experienced severe vaginal atrophy,
they realized that vitamin E has no effect, and they have switched to NeuEve. Luckily the soft tissue does not have
a "fracture" like bones. As long as it is not too late, the atrophy can still recover with NeuEve.
