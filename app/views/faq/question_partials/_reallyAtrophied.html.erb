If you are really atrophied, you should use both the cream and the suppository. The suppository works inside the
vagina to revive the mucous glands for self-lubrication, while the cream works on the outside. Therefore, these
two products are made with different ingredients and are not interchangeable. For example, if you have dry
mouth, you can take the artificial saliva to find relief, but it may not help dried lips, to which a chapstick
can help. Many women who used NeuEve say that combining both the cream and the suppository gets better relief.
