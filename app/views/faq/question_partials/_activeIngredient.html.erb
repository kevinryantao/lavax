As NeuEve is natural product, not a drug, it is difficult to say which ingredient is the active one. I would say
that
all ingredients listed in the NeuEve formulation contribute to its effect. For example, if you try to lose
weight by
skipping breakfast, you may get morning dizziness. The hidden cause is hunger. You can treat the dizziness with
a
drug, or you can start eating breakfast to get rid of your hunger and also the dizziness. If breakfast works,
what is
the active ingredient in the breakfast that “cures” the dizziness?
