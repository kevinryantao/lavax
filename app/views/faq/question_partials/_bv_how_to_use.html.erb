One suppository lasts about 3-5 days, so you can use one in every 3 days. One pack of 3 suppositories is good for 9
days. If you have BV with the fishy odor, after one suppository you may notice relief. Please do not stop as BV may
come back if not completely suppressed. Use the second one in day 4, and the third one in day 7. If your BV is
completely cleared by then, use the Gold formula the second day after the next menstruation is cleared. This will
help stop BV from coming back for the next month. If after using all 3 suppositories of the BV kit, you still not
recovered, use the Gold suppository on day 10. In most cases, your BV will be cleared. However, if you used all 4
suppositories in the package and your BV is still not cleared but with substantial improvement, you can order the
NeuEve Gold for the advanced care. If you do not notice improvement at all, your condition might not be BV and you
will need to visit a gyn to have a checkup.
