This is a great question. The NeuEve product is fully food grade without much taste. It has no hormones, nor
herbs
(e.g., black cohosh and wild yam). It should be safe even ingesting orally, just like eating a chocolate. Women
with vaginal dryness often have unpleasant odor, which repels the partner from oral sex. Using NeuEve routinely,
odor will be gone, and women will smell fresh. Conversely, the estrogen cream is unsafe. Not only does it
increase
the risk for cancer, it can also pass the female hormone to the partner to reduce his male function.
