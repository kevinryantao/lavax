Menopause also causes osteoporosis, but it is reversible without estrogen. Calcium and vitamin D can do it.
Likewise,
vaginal atrophy should also be reversible without estrogen. Our product NeuEve can do it because NeuEve provides
nutrients for the vaginal tissue as does calcium and vitamin D for bones.

Before a woman reaches menopause, her vagina is moisturized by mucus glands. After menopause, estrogen reduces,
the
vaginal gland dries, and the mucosa shrinks. Estrogen can control these glands, but the glands can also be
activated
by other things.

Let us look at dry eyes as an example. When tear glands shrink with aging, eyes dry. People often use artificial
tears
to find relief, but the effect wears off quickly. It is better to revive dried tear glands, which provide
auto-lubrication 24/7. Tear glands can be activated centrally by deep sorrow or locally by cutting an onion. But
onion
smells bad. It would be nice if a rose could be used as the tear stimulant.

We have found the “rose” for reviving dried glands in women. This is the secret of NeuEve. Due to revival of
mucus-secreting glands, the vaginal mucosa is auto-lubricated and moisturized 24/7. Many women using NeuEve
report
reversal of atrophy. We use “rose” to represent NeuEve because it clears up odor by restoring vaginal ecology.
Women
smell fresh and feel rejuvenated after using NeuEve.
