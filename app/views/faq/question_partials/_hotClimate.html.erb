The suppository is formulated to melt at the body temperature (98°F) so that it can release its ingredients once
applied. However, if your area is hotter than the body temperature, the product can become soft during shipment.
When you receive the product, you can store it in a refrigerator. This will make it hard again and easy to use.
Keeping it in a refrigerator will not hurt its quality. Chocolate melts at the body temperature and may become
brittle after storing in a refrigerator. The reason is that chocolate has sugar crystals, but NeuEve does not have
sugar. Therefore, its quality is not compromised when it is stored in a refrigerator. In the summer time, a major
challenge during shipping is the hot temperature in a car or a mailbox under the sun. It can be as hot as 120°F. The
suppository can become soft when you receive it, but it will become hard once indoors and after putting in a
refrigerator for several hours. Then, you can take it out before use. If your house is constantly air conditioned it
should be OK to put the NeuEve in the room temperature for a longer time after taking out from a refrigerator.
Otherwise, keeping it in a refrigerator in the summer time is better.
