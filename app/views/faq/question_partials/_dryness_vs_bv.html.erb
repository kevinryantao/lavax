When a woman is in reproductive age, her vagina is filled with mucous and

secretion that feed the vaginal friendly Lactobacillus bacteria. The female hormones

support the vaginal secretion. When the woman reaches menopause, estrogen reduces and

the vaginal secretion reduces as a part of aging. As a result, the vagina becomes dry and

the lining thins. Let us use the water level in a river as an analogy. When the water level

is low, fish disappears and amphibians increase, causing an ecology shift. When the

vaginal ecology shifts, good bacteria reduce and bad ones increase, and BV occurs. The

odor might not be caused by the padding, but may be caused by the hormonal change

inside the body.

The NeuEve works by restoring vaginal auto-secretion. When it relieves the

dryness, it also restores ecology. In many cases, BV is cleared, just like when the water

level in a river resumes, fish comes back. However, this method only works for BV, but

not for other true infections, like yeast, trich and STIs.

The ingredients in all of our formulas are the same. Only different amounts for

Gold, Silver and Silk. The BV-Clear Kit is the same as Silver. The ability to clear BV

odor is the strongest for Gold, milder for Silver and mildest for Silk. If you have already

tried Gold, please continue using it as it is our strongest formula for both dryness and BV.

The only tradeoff is that some women who have many years of severe dryness and

atrophy may not tolerate it. Their tolerance can increase after using the milder Silk and

Silver for some time.
