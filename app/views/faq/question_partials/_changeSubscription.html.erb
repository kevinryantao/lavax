Paypal does not allow changes. The word "Silver" cannot be removed once subscription starts. The best way to change
the formula of your subscription is for you to log in Paypal and cancel your existing subscription on Silver and to
resubscribe the Gold formula from <%= link_to 'www.neueve.com', root_path %>. This way, your Paypal account will
show only the Gold formula and the change of formula will occur.
