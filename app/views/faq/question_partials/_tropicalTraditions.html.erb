<blockquote>
    Tropical Traditions Palm Shortening comes from small scale family farms in South America. These farmers are
    certified by ProForest, which ensures that they meet strict social, environmental and technical criteria. With
    regard to environmental criteria, the assessments are carried out at the landscape and operational level at both the
    farms and processing facilities. These assessments cover environmental impact on the soil, water, air, biodiversity
    and local communities. The lands the farmers use are not lands that were deforested. The lands used to grow the palm
    fruit are lands previously used for agricultural purposes (cattle, rice, banana).
