Bread alone is a great food, but adding butter makes it better. Likewise, the effect of
NeuEve can be improved by other things, such as calcium supplements. A plausible
explanation is that after menopause women often become osteoporosis with the loss of
calcium, which also drains energy from the body. As a result, many parts of the body
shrink, including the vagina. Supplementing calcium may help block energy drainage.
This helps NeuEve to work better in relieving vaginal dryness and atrophy.
