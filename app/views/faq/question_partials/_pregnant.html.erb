This is a great question. Theoretically, nothing in the suppository is harmful since it is made with all food
ingredients. However, it is a legal disclaimer that we must tell women during pregnancy that they should not use
the product because birth defect happens randomly for no apparent reason. If a birth defect happens to a woman
who had used our product during pregnancy and we did not have this disclaimer, we could get into legal trouble
and bankrupt the business.

I hope that you can understand that as a small business, we must make this disclaimer so that we can survive and
continue providing the valuable products to women who really need them without going through possible legal
mess. If you get pregnant or are with a clear intention to conceive it would be on the safe side to avoid using
all vaginal products including NeuEve. This way, you would not have to suspect the safety of any of these
products that might be harmful to your baby.
