NeuEve is not a drug or antibiotic. It does not treat any infections. BV is not a true infection but an
imbalance of
vaginal ecology. Unlike antibiotics that treat BV by killing dominant microbial species, NeuEve uses a natural,
ecological approach to restore the ecological balance. It changes the vaginal environment from dry to moist,
like
adding water to a dried river. The newly established vaginal condition becomes favorable for good bacteria but
not bad
bacteria. As a result, feminine odor is eliminated.
