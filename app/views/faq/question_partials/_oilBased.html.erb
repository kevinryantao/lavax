The special formula with timed and extended release requires oil. Also, oil does better for the delivery of the
oil-soluble vitamins and for lubrication of the vagina in order to prevent pain during sexual intercourse. It is
also
good for moisturizing the vaginal mucous membrane. A thin film of oil on the mucosa protects it from pathogens
like
fungi or bacteria. Our product uses only food-grade all natural vegetable oil (e.g., palm and palm kernel oil)
as its
base. No synthetic or petroleum-based oil is used.
