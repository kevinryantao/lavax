In comparison with cream, vaginal suppositories allow women to deliver the product to the place where the
vaginal
dryness and malodor occur, not only limited to the labia. Also, cream can be messy and difficult to control
dosage.
Suppositories are cleaner and also better for dosage control. For example, the effect of one suppository can
last up
to seven days, especially with the NeuEve Gold formula.
