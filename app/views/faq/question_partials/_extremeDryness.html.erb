To better explain this situation, let us use dry lips as an example. If one has had dry
lips for a long time, say more than a month, micro-cracks occur on the lips. The tissues
underneath the cracks are inflamed. Just opening the mouth can cause pain, becoming
sensitive to everything, even to wind and water. At this stage, one may not be able to
tolerate a strong product such as a wrinkle cream. The milder ChapStick can help protect
dried lips by sealing the cracks. After using the ChapStick for some time, the cracks are
healed, and the tolerance improves. Then, one can use a stronger product like a wrinkle
cream for rejuvenation.

After using Silk formula for a month or two, the micro-cracks in the dried vagina are
healed and painful sex and dryness are alleviated. Then, you can switch to the stronger
formula Silver for better maintenance and faster recovery of atrophy, but if you still feel
pain and tenderness, continue using Silk will be better. Some customers said that using
the Silk formula once in 3-4 days and NeuEve cream for the vulva once daily works well
to ease severe dryness.
