<h3>
    Cause of Vaginal Odor
</h3>
<p>
    Unpleasant vaginal odor is often caused by bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is not a true infection
    but an upset of the vaginal normal ecology. For example, if the water level of a river is running
    low, the number of fish would decrease and amphibians would thrive. This is called ecological shift.
    During BV, the good bacterium Lactobacillus decreases, but the unwanted bad bacteria increase. The
    cause for such an ecological shift is not clear, but risk factors include antibiotic use, douching,
    hormone reduction due to menopause or pregnancy, and change of sexual partner.
<h3>
    Treatment of Vaginal Odor
</h3>
<p>
    Current treatment options: Prescription drugs include antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole,
    which are often ineffective. Killing of the “amphibians” (bad bacteria) by antibiotics does not
    increase the number of fish (good bacteria) if the water level in the river is still running low.
    Over-the-counter products include douches and Lactobacillus capsules. Research found that douche often causes BV
    because it disrupts vaginal ecology. Lactobacillus capsules are like putting more fish into a river in order to
    outnumber the “amphibians,” but if the water level in the river is running low, all added “fish” will soon die out.
    Overall, there is not a fully effective product to treat vaginal odor.

<h3>
    NeuEve : designed by scientists to relieve vaginal odor and dryness
</h3>
<p>
    The patented NeuEve suppository is designed by a gynecologist and is made with all FDA-approved
    natural and safe ingredients. It can relieve vaginal dryness of many causes, including menopause, breastfeeding,
    chemotherapy, hysterectomy, side effect of medications, Sjögren's syndrome, and stress or anxiety. It addresses both
    the symptoms and cause (with plant-derived natural nutrients) without side effects of estrogen. It instantly soothes
    intimate tissue with moisture that lasts for days. NeuEve gently coats dry vagina with a thin layer of protective
    film, lowering the risk of vaginal irritation and bladder infection. Unlike other lubricants, it will not cause
    burning or yeast infection. Continuous using the product will help stopping the process of vaginal atrophy.

<h3>
    NeuEve : restore your vaginal ecology
</h3>
<p>
    Additionally, NeuEve suppository can also eliminate vaginal odor by a mechanism called ecological restoration. For
    example, to restore the previous, normal ecology of a dried river, in which fish diminishes and amphibians dominate,
    the best way is to increase its water level. This can result in more “fish” and less “amphibians” naturally. Killing
    “amphibians” (bad bacteria) by antibiotics or adding more “fish” (good bacteria) into the dried river may not fix
    the problem or may provide only temporary solution. On the other hand, the effect of NeuEve can be rapid and
    long-lasting. In less than 24 hours the odor will be diminished. Continuously using the product will help keep
    malodor from coming back.
</p>
<p>
    Special patented formulation allows extended and timed release for up to 7 days. This makes the formula more
    affordable and convenient to use due to its long-lasting effect. Continuous use of NeuEve suppository can restore
    the vaginal self-cleansing mechanism and unleash the self-healing power. Use NeuEve and vaginal dryness, vaginal
    odor, and painful intercourse, will be history.
