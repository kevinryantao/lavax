        About the proprietary blend, it is a mixture of ingredients in trace amounts, mainly
        vitamins, amino acids and other nutrients for local nourishment of the mucous tissues,
        like calcium and vitamin D for bones. All ingredients are vegan, gluten-free, food-grade, edible and of plant
        source and should be safe. The composition is patented and is a part of our trade secret.
        Many businesses have trade secrets, such as the flavor in Coke or the spice in Kentucky
        Fried Chicken. If you ever had these things, you have consumed a product that has a trade
        secret. It is perfectly OK to consume a product without knowing its trade secret.

        Yes. Customers have reported that taking regular calcium supplement (~1 g/day) and
        fish oil (eating fish or flaxseed oil if allergic to fish) can help. If you cannot take any of
        these supplements, just eat some nuts and fish.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="whySupplements"></a>Why would I need to supplement with other things if NeuEve works?
        </em></strong></h4>
        Bread alone is a great food, but adding butter makes it better. Likewise, the effect of
        NeuEve can be improved by other things, such as calcium supplements. A plausible
        explanation is that after menopause women often become osteoporosis with the loss of
        calcium, which also drains energy from the body. As a result, many parts of the body
        shrink, including the vagina. Supplementing calcium may help block energy drainage.
        This helps NeuEve to work better in relieving vaginal dryness and atrophy.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="platinum"></a>I tried the Gold formula and like it. Do you have anything stronger?
        </em></strong></h4>
        Yes. We have a Platinum formula that is stronger than the Gold formula. Since the
        demand is low, we have not listed it on the website. If you want to order the Platinum
        formula, please purchase the Gold formula on-line and send us a message
        at <%= mail_to "NeuEve.Suppositories@gmail.com" %> specifically
        requesting for the Platinum formula. The price is the same as the Gold formula.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="dryEyeMouth"></a>I have tried NeuEve suppositories, but I still feel dry. Also, my eyes and mouth also
            feel terribly dry. Is there anything that I can do to help improve this dryness?
        </em></strong></h4>
        Since you have dry eyes, dry mouth and vaginal dryness, you might have a condition
        called Sjogren's syndrome. It is an autoimmune disease that causes glands to dry out,
        including the glands in the eyes, mouth and vaginal tract. Please consult your doctor to
        confirm diagnosis. If Sjogren's syndrome is diagnosed, there is no cure for this condition.
        However, there are natural remedies to manage it. Below are my recommendations:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fish oil. If you are allergic to fish oil, you can take flaxseed oil instead. It is
                the omega fatty acids that help.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sea buckthorn oil (2,000 mg a day). This special oil from the berries of a cold
                weather shrub is a special essential fatty acid called omega-7. It is very helpful at
                improving lubrication throughout the body – including tears, saliva, and vagina.
            </li>
            <li>
                Other treatments helpful for dry eyes and mouth include: Take a B-complex
                vitamin (50 mg a day), and sugar-free lemon drops or chewing gum.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check for food allergies. Get your blood tested for wheat allergy. Women with
                Sjogren's often have allergy to gluten. If wheat allergy is an issue, stop eating bread will
                help you relieve dryness symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take probiotics regularly, such as Dannon yogurt, Activia, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue using NeuEve for managing vaginal dryness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drink plenty of water and use a humidifier in the house.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="jelly"></a>Lubricant is cheap. How is NeuEve better than Jelly?
        </em></strong></h4>
        Scientific research found that most men can be sexually active well into their 80s, but women have to go through
        menopause at mid age. The gender difference in sexuality and aging puts a great challenge on marriages.
        Therefore,
        products that can help women overcome the aging effect are important for maintaining marriage and relationship.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most jellies (lubricants or moisturizers) are made with chemicals like glycerin, propylene glycol and/or
        polyethylene
        glycol (PEG), the same chemicals for making automobile antifreeze which is well known for its toxicity. Jellies
        provide only a short-term lubrication but can speed up the aging process by tissue dehydration. After using
        jellies, a
        woman’s vagina shrinks, causing a rapid loss of the ability to have intimacy. Some women may have to go through
        surgery in order to keep their relationships, while others may have to forgo romantic intimacy altogether at a
        relatively young age.
        <br>
        <br>
        NeuEve is different. It can defy aging by reviving the mucus gland in women and reversing the atrophy. Many
        women who
        previously suffered severe vaginal atrophy have recovered by using NeuEve. If NeuEve is used early and
        regularly, the
        onset of vaginal atrophy can be substantially delayed. Therefore, even though jellies are cheap, their toxic
        chemicals
        can speed up aging and their effect wears off rapidly. NeuEve has a long-lasting effect. One application lasts
        7-8
        days. It is a worthwhile investment for women because it can help extend their romantic intimacy and good
        marriage
        well into the golden years.

        Vaginal dryness is not a disease that can be cured. It is an aging outcome, like wrinkles. Wrinkles show up when
        people reach mid-age, say in the 40s, but women often start using cream at a much younger age. The reason is
        that an
        early and regular use of cream can result in a later onset of wrinkles. If a woman stops using the anti-aging
        cream
        before mid-age, wrinkles may show up sooner. Wrinkles can be removed by botox, but it is costly and not without
        risk.
        Therefore using cream to manage wrinkles early is a better investment than having a botox later. Likewise, early
        and
        regular use of NeuEve can help women delay the onset of vaginal atrophy. It allows women to enjoy many more
        years of
        romantic intimacy and a healthful lifestyle.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="vaginalDrynessAndOdor"></a>Why do women suffer from vaginal dryness and odor?
        </em></strong></h4>

        When women suffer from vaginal dryness, the vaginal ecological environment has changed from moist to dry. This
        change
        can drive an ecological shift in dominant vaginal bacterial flora. For example, if a river dries, fish would die
        and
        other live forms that can accommodate low water and dried land, such as amphibians, may thrive. This is called
        ecological shift. When such a shift occurs in the vaginal ecology, bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs and it can
        cause
        pungent fishy odor.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="selectingFormula" id="selectingFormula"></a>How do I select the right NeuEve suppository formula?
        </em></strong></h4>

        There are two plans: recovery and maintenance. For women with severe dryness and atrophy, it may be too painful
        to
        have intimacy and they may be highly sensitive due to cracks and spotting. These women can begin with the
        recovery
        plan first by using the mild Silk formula (8/pk) for one month (use 1 in 4 days). Then, they can switch to the
        regular
        Silver formula (use 1 in 5 days) for faster recovery. Depending on the individual, one or more packs of Silver
        formulas may be needed for achieving recovery (regaining the ability to have intimacy without pain). At this
        point,
        women can switch to the Gold formula for long-term maintenance.

        <br><br>

        For women who have mild vaginal dryness and painful sex but who can still have sex, they can start directly with
        the
        maintenance plan using the Silver formula. It is a good idea to use a few suppositories (1 in 5 days) first to
        condition the dried vaginal tissue before having intimacy. After using 6 Silver suppositories in a month, the
        dryness
        and dyspareunia will reduce and these women can switch to the Gold formula and use one in 7-8 days for long-term
        maintenance of the vaginal wellness.

        <br><br>

        For women having just odor (e.g., BV) without atrophy, they can use the Silver formula suppository. Just use one
        suppository, and the odor will usually be gone. Continuous using two more suppositories will provide more
        assurance
        that the odor will not return. The remaining suppositories can be saved for future use in case the odor comes
        back at
        a later time. However, if the NeuEve suppositories are used regularly to maintain vaginal wellness, the odor
        will be
        gone for good. Below is a flowchart to illustrate how to select these three formulas.

        The NeuEve Silk formula is milder, suitable for highly sensitive women, but it only lasts 3-4 days. The Silver
        formula
        is moderate and the effect can last for 5-6 days. It is designed for clearing odor and eases dryness quickly and
        can
        be used for both recovery and maintenance. The NeuEve Gold formula is more concentrated in certain ingredients
        and
        with extended release. It is designed for long-term relieving of dryness and atrophy and suitable for easy
        maintenance
        (use 1 per week) because it can last 7-8 days.

        <br><br>

        If you have had vaginal dryness and painful sex for some time and are not sure which formula is right for you
        based
        upon the flowchart above, it would be a good idea to start first with the Silk, then the Silver, and finally the
        Gold.
        Because the Silver formula can be used for both recovery and maintenance, it is sold in most stores that carry
        NeuEve
        products. If you use the Silver formula first and feel burning, you may be the sensitive type. You can order the
        Silk
        formula online on this website if it is not available in the store near you.

        The major difference among Silk, Silver and Gold formulas are concentrations of certain
        ingredients to make women to feel mild, moderate and strong, like different levels
        of spicy hot peppers of the same dish in a restaurant. Our Gold and Silver formulas,
        sustained and timed-release formulations are introduced. The timed-release formulations
        can be observed in name brand lawn fertilizers that have different sized granules, each
        releases the fertilizer at a different time.

            dryness. Should I use the strongest formula instead?
        </em></strong></h4>

        To better explain this situation, let us use dry lips as an example. If one has had dry
        lips for a long time, say more than a month, micro-cracks occur on the lips. The tissues
        underneath the cracks are inflamed. Just opening the mouth can cause pain, becoming
        sensitive to everything, even to wind and water. At this stage, one may not be able to
        tolerate a strong product such as a wrinkle cream. The milder ChapStick can help protect
        dried lips by sealing the cracks. After using the ChapStick for some time, the cracks are
        healed, and the tolerance improves. Then, one can use a stronger product like a wrinkle
        cream for rejuvenation.

        <br><br>

        After using Silk formula for a month or two, the micro-cracks in the dried vagina are
        healed and painful sex and dryness are alleviated. Then, you can switch to the stronger
        formula Silver for better maintenance and faster recovery of atrophy, but if you still feel
        pain and tenderness, continue using Silk will be better. Some customers said that using
        the Silk formula once in 3-4 days and NeuEve cream for the vulva once daily works well
        to ease severe dryness.

        <br>
        The vaginal suppository is inserted into the vagina similarly to a tampon. Once introduced, it dissolves within
        10-15
        minutes and achieves its soothing effect entirely unnoticed. Before it dissolves, you should remain laying down
        to
        prevent the suppository from dropping out. It works best in 2nd and 3rd days. Once dissolved, it will remain in
        the
        vagina without seepage and will last for 4-8 days depending on the product used. Unlike a tampon, you will not
        need to
        withdraw the suppository once inserted. It will disappear with time, similar to the disappearance of applied
        body
        lotion.

        </em></strong></h4>

        Some women may have suffered dryness for a long time, so that they do not have enough secretion to dissolve the
        water-soluble portion of the NeuEve suppository. The suppository includes both oil-soluble and water-soluble
        materials
        like a multi-vitamin pill (e.g., vitamin E is oil soluble while vitamin C is water soluble). As a result, a
        portion of
        the water-soluble materials may leak out. You should not be worried about this. Each time when you use a NeuEve
        suppository, a small portion of the water-soluble material will be dissolved. Gradually, the glands will become
        revived and more and more water-soluble materials will be dissolved and play a role in the maintenance of
        feminine
        wellness.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="contraceptive"></a>Do NeuEve vaginal suppositories provide contraceptive protection?

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="condoms"></a>Does the use of NeuEve vaginal suppositories influence the effect of condoms?
        </em></strong></h4>

        Latex condoms can be damaged by a petroleum product, but NeuEve is based on palm oil. However, to be on the safe
        side, you should not use NeuEve simultaneously with a latex condom, but you may use non-latex condoms.

            <a name="otherInfections"></a>Since NeuEve can eliminate odor caused by BV, can it take care of other vaginal infections?
        </em></strong></h4>

        NeuEve is not a drug or antibiotic. It does not treat any infections. BV is not a true infection but an
        imbalance of
        vaginal ecology. Unlike antibiotics that treat BV by killing dominant microbial species, NeuEve uses a natural,
        ecological approach to restore the ecological balance. It changes the vaginal environment from dry to moist,
        like
        adding water to a dried river. The newly established vaginal condition becomes favorable for good bacteria but
        not bad
        bacteria. As a result, feminine odor is eliminated.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="relieveAtrophyWithoutHormones"></a>How does NeuEve work in relieving vaginal atrophy without hormone?
        </em></strong></h4>

        Menopause also causes osteoporosis, but it is reversible without estrogen. Calcium and vitamin D can do it.
        Likewise,
        vaginal atrophy should also be reversible without estrogen. Our product NeuEve can do it because NeuEve provides
        nutrients for the vaginal tissue as does calcium and vitamin D for bones.

        <br><br>

        Before a woman reaches menopause, her vagina is moisturized by mucus glands. After menopause, estrogen reduces,
        the
        vaginal gland dries, and the mucosa shrinks. Estrogen can control these glands, but the glands can also be
        activated
        by other things.

        <br><br>

        Let us look at dry eyes as an example. When tear glands shrink with aging, eyes dry. People often use artificial
        tears
        to find relief, but the effect wears off quickly. It is better to revive dried tear glands, which provide
        auto-lubrication 24/7. Tear glands can be activated centrally by deep sorrow or locally by cutting an onion. But
        onion
        smells bad. It would be nice if a rose could be used as the tear stimulant.

        <br><br>

        We have found the “rose” for reviving dried glands in women. This is the secret of NeuEve. Due to revival of
        mucus-secreting glands, the vaginal mucosa is auto-lubricated and moisturized 24/7. Many women using NeuEve
        report
        reversal of atrophy. We use “rose” to represent NeuEve because it clears up odor by restoring vaginal ecology.
        Women
        smell fresh and feel rejuvenated after using NeuEve.

            <a name="activeIngredient"></a>What is the active ingredient in NeuEve that works?

        As NeuEve is natural product, not a drug, it is difficult to say which ingredient is the active one. I would say
        that
        all ingredients listed in the NeuEve formulation contribute to its effect. For example, if you try to lose
        weight by
        skipping breakfast, you may get morning dizziness. The hidden cause is hunger. You can treat the dizziness with
        a
        drug, or you can start eating breakfast to get rid of your hunger and also the dizziness. If breakfast works,
        what is
        the active ingredient in the breakfast that “cures” the dizziness?

        </em></strong></h4>

        NeuEve is not a drug and cannot treat any disease. However, two women suffering from lichen sclerosus have
        purchased
        NeuEve suppositories repeatedly. This suggests that they might have found some relief with NeuEve.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="suppositoryForm"></a>Why is NeuEve produced in suppository form?<br>
        </em></strong></h4>

        In comparison with cream, vaginal suppositories allow women to deliver the product to the place where the
        vaginal
        dryness and malodor occur, not only limited to the labia. Also, cream can be messy and difficult to control
        dosage.
        Suppositories are cleaner and also better for dosage control. For example, the effect of one suppository can
        last up
        to seven days, especially with the NeuEve Gold formula.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="oilBased"></a>Why are NeuEve suppositories oil-based?<br>
        </em></strong></h4>

        The special formula with timed and extended release requires oil. Also, oil does better for the delivery of the
        oil-soluble vitamins and for lubrication of the vagina in order to prevent pain during sexual intercourse. It is
        also
        good for moisturizing the vaginal mucous membrane. A thin film of oil on the mucosa protects it from pathogens
        like
        fungi or bacteria. Our product uses only food-grade all natural vegetable oil (e.g., palm and palm kernel oil)
        as its
        base. No synthetic or petroleum-based oil is used.

        </em></strong></h4>

        Based on customers’ feedback, there may be three situations:
        <br><br>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Can still have sex, but feel like sandpaper (dryness).</strong> Use NeuEve 30 minutes to 1
                hour before having sex usually works well. It works best 1-2 days after each application.
                If a woman has used NeuEve routinely such as once a week, she can have sex at anytime
                like a young woman.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Have sex with pain (dyspareunia) or cannot have sex.</strong> This means atrophy has
                occurred. Using just one NeuEve suppository is not enough to reverse the atrophy. It
                will require the use of NeuEve continuously for 1-4 months before recovery. Please be
                patient to allow NeuEve working for you for a few weeks. You can test for readiness by
                inserting 1-3 fingers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Vaginal muscle spasm when having sex (vaginismus).</strong> These women might have
                slight atrophy, but painful sex causes muscle memory. One customer had vaginismus
                and could not have sex for 3 years. She tried many things (estrogen, moisturizer, and
                jellies) without luck. She used 3 NeuEve suppositories and felt self-lubricating like a
                young woman. Her love life hits the roof.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        In summary, if you are the first situation, use NeuEve 1 day before having sex may be the
        best. Also, since individual case is different, you can experimenting with NeuEve and
        find the best application method for yourself. Since the product is made with safe and
        food-grade natural ingredients, there is no harmful effect for using it often.

            NeuEve. Now, I have infection and have to go to my gynecologist to get treatment. Could
            your suppository cause my infection?<br>
        </em></strong></h4>

        NeuEve itself cannot cause infection, because it is made under sterile
        condition; there are no microorganisms. Also, NeuEve is made with 100% oil-base
        without water, so it cannot support microbial growth. Then, what else might have caused
        infection? There might be three possibilities.
        <br><br>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Infection from sex partner.</strong> Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common. I
                assume that you did not wear a condom. Even though you do not need contraception
                after menopause, you are still vulnerable to STIs. It is always a good idea to wear a
                condom for protection against STIs when you have a new partner. Such protection is
                mutual; the male can also be protected from possible STIs. NeuEve is oil-based and
                might not be compatible with latex condoms, so non-latex condoms should be used.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Old yeast infection coming back.</strong> If a woman had yeast infection when she
                was young, the yeast might become dormant when she becomes menopausal. The
                rejuvenation effect of NeuEve makes the environment moist again by promoting mucous
                secretion, which may allow her dormant yeast to grow back. But if a woman never
                had yeast infection before, she cannot get yeast by using NeuEve. If you feel that you
                get yeast again, you can manage it as you did before with over-the-counter antifungal
                medications.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Honeymoon bladder.</strong> The vaginal tract is home to billions of indigenous bacteria.
                Some could be mobilized to the urinary tract after intimacy. A customer with
                vaginal atrophy could not have intimacy for many years. After using NeuEve, she
                regained the ability to have intimacy. Then, she enjoyed so much intimacy that she
                got honeymoon bladder in her 50s. Having a young woman’s trouble at an older age
                suggests that NeuEve can turn back the aging clock. To prevent honeymoon bladder, it
                is recommended to drink a lot of cranberry juice or water and empty bladder immediately
                after intimacy. In case honeymoon bladder is suspected, do not panic. It is just urinary
                tract infection (UTI). See your doctor and handle it as if you were a “honeymooner.”
                According to medical review articles, the best way to manage recurrent UTI (at least 2
                UTIs in 6 months) is to take Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin) once a day for 6 months. You
                can ask your doctor for prescription.

        In summary, the rejuvenation effect of NeuEve can help improve the ability of intimacy.
        After you use NeuEve for a while, you may be able to enjoy sex like a young woman.
        The bad news is that you may have to handle some issues of a young woman, like
        preventing STIs, yeast infection and honeymoon bladder. The good news is that you do
        not need to worry about menstruation.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="pregnant"></a>Is there something in the suppositories that is harmful to unborn babies? I noticed you advise not using the
            suppositories if pregnant. My concern is if I were to conceive and not know yet I was pregnant and be using
            the suppositories I would not want to endanger my child.
        </em></strong></h4>

        This is a great question. Theoretically, nothing in the suppository is harmful since it is made with all food
        ingredients. However, it is a legal disclaimer that we must tell women during pregnancy that they should not use
        the product because birth defect happens randomly for no apparent reason. If a birth defect happens to a woman
        who had used our product during pregnancy and we did not have this disclaimer, we could get into legal trouble
        and bankrupt the business.

        <br><br>
        I hope that you can understand that as a small business, we must make this disclaimer so that we can survive and
        continue providing the valuable products to women who really need them without going through possible legal
        mess. If you get pregnant or are with a clear intention to conceive it would be on the safe side to avoid using
        all vaginal products including NeuEve. This way, you would not have to suspect the safety of any of these
        products that might be harmful to your baby.

        <h4><strong><em>
            <a name="oralSex"></a>Can my partner do oral sex while using this product? Will it be unsafe and hurt my partner?<br>
        </em></strong></h4>

        This is a great question. The NeuEve product is fully food grade without much taste. It has no hormones, nor
        herbs
        (e.g., black cohosh and wild yam). It should be safe even ingesting orally, just like eating a chocolate. Women
        with vaginal dryness often have unpleasant odor, which repels the partner from oral sex. Using NeuEve routinely,
        odor will be gone, and women will smell fresh. Conversely, the estrogen cream is unsafe. Not only does it
        increase
        the risk for cancer, it can also pass the female hormone to the partner to reduce his male function.
